## Slide 4: GitHub Product Tiers

| Tier | Target | Hosting | Identity | Key Features |
|------|--------|---------|----------|--------------|
| **GitHub Free** | Individuals / OSS | Cloud (github.com) | GitHub.com account | Public & private repos, basic Actions (2,000 min/mo) |
| **GitHub Team** | Small teams (5–50) | Cloud (github.com) | GitHub.com account | Protected branches, code owners, 3,000 Actions min/mo |
| **GitHub Enterprise Cloud (GHEC)** | Large orgs (50+) | Cloud (github.com) | GitHub.com or EMU (IdP-managed) | Enterprise account, SAML SSO, audit log streaming, GHAS, 50,000 Actions min/mo |
| **GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)** | Regulated / on-prem | Self-hosted (your infra) | Built-in or SAML/LDAP | Full air-gap support, data residency, VM appliance model |

> **Presenter Note**: *This is the landscape. Most enterprise conversations center on GHEC — either standard or with EMU — and GHES for on-prem. The key differentiators are identity management, data residency, and compliance requirements. Let's note that GHEC with EMU is a fundamentally different identity model than standard GHEC — we'll dig into that in Scenario 1.*

---

## Slide 5: Enterprise Managed Users (EMU) vs. Standard GHEC

| Dimension | Standard GHEC | GHEC with EMU |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| **Account Creation** | Users create their own GitHub.com accounts | Accounts provisioned via IdP (SCIM) |
| **Account Ownership** | User owns the account | Enterprise owns the account |
| **SSO** | SAML SSO (user links existing account) | Built-in — IdP is the source of truth |
| **Username Format** | User-chosen | `IdP-username_shortcode` (e.g., `jdoe_contoso`) |
| **Public Repos** | ✅ Users can create & contribute to public repos | ✗ EMU accounts cannot interact outside the enterprise |
| **Forking Public OSS** | ✅ Yes | ✗ No — EMU accounts are enterprise-scoped |
| **Inner Source** | ✅ Internal repos visible across orgs | ✅ Internal repos visible across orgs |
| **Personal Repos** | ✅ Users have personal repos | ⚠️ Can own repos within enterprise (if policy allows), but not outside it |
| **Gists** | ✅ Users can create gists | ✗ EMU accounts cannot create gists |
| **Guest Collaborators** | N/A — outside collaborators invited directly | ✅ Guest collaborator role for external users (limited repo access, provisioned via IdP with restricted role) |
| **Identity Lifecycle** | Manual — user manages own account, admin manages access | Automated — provision/deprovision via IdP SCIM |
| **Account Deprovisioning** | Admin removes from org (account persists) | IdP deprovisions → account suspended/removed |

> **Presenter Note**: *This is one of the most important slides. EMU gives you complete lifecycle control — when someone leaves the company, their account is deprovisioned automatically. But the trade-off is significant: EMU accounts live in a walled garden. They can't contribute to open source, can't fork public repos, can't create gists, and can't use their account outside the enterprise. However, they CAN own private repos within the enterprise if your enterprise policy allows it. For organizations that need external collaborators on EMU-owned repos, there's a "guest collaborator" role — these are provisioned via the IdP like all managed user accounts, but receive a restricted role with limited, repo-scoped access. For many organizations, this is the right trade-off for security and compliance. For others — especially those with active open-source contributors — standard GHEC with SAML SSO is the better choice.*

## Slide 6: Decision Tree — Choosing Your Base Architecture

> **Important — Data Residency Update**: GitHub now offers **GHEC with data residency** (hosted on GHE.com), providing regional data storage (EU, Australia, US, Japan) with full cloud features including Copilot. This is a compelling alternative to GHES when data sovereignty — not air-gap — is the driver. All enterprises on GHE.com use Enterprise Managed Users.

> **Presenter Note**: *This decision tree is the core framework. On-prem requirements push you to Mixed, identity control pushes you to EMU, otherwise Multi-Org is the default. Note the branch for data residency requirements where air-gap isn't needed — GHEC with data residency on GHE.com is the recommended path there, giving full cloud features including Copilot. We'll cover each base pattern first, then the decision framework.*

### Enterprise Managed Users — Full Cloud, Full Control

> 💡 **EMU and Multi-Org are not mutually exclusive.** EMU controls *identity*; Multi-Org controls *structure*. Most large enterprises combine both — EMU for identity lifecycle + multiple orgs for BU or project separation. The scenarios below are presented separately for clarity, but expect to blend them.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Presenter Note**: *This is the cleanest architecture. Your IdP is the single source of truth. Users, groups, and roles are defined there and provisioned into GitHub via SCIM. When someone joins the company, they get a GitHub account. When they leave, it's deprovisioned. Teams in GitHub map to groups in your IdP. Policies cascade from the Enterprise level down to Orgs and Repos.*

---

## Slide 9: EMU Only — Pros, Cons & Requirements

| ✅ Pros | ✗ Cons | 📋 Requirements |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Complete identity lifecycle control via IdP | EMU accounts cannot interact outside the enterprise | Supported IdP: Entra ID, Okta, or PingFederate |
| Automated provisioning/deprovisioning (SCIM) | No public repo contributions from EMU accounts | SCIM provisioning configured and tested |
| Enterprise owns all accounts — no data leakage risk | No personal forks of public repos, no gists | SAML SSO configured with IdP |
| Username follows enterprise naming convention (`user_shortcode`) | Users cannot reuse existing GitHub.com accounts | GitHub Enterprise Cloud license |
| Team membership synced from IdP groups | Separate personal GitHub.com account needed for OSS work | IdP group structure mapped to GitHub teams |
| Centralized policy enforcement (Enterprise → Org → Repo) | Learning curve — EMU accounts behave differently | Enterprise shortcode selected (appended as username suffix — cannot be changed later) |
| Simplified audit — all activity tied to corporate identity | Cannot convert existing standard GHEC enterprise to EMU | New enterprise creation (EMU is set at creation time) |
| No "orphaned accounts" — clean offboarding | Limited marketplace app compatibility | Admin team trained on EMU-specific behaviors |
| IP allow list enforcement at enterprise level | Namespace collisions possible if shortcode overlaps | Network/firewall rules for SCIM endpoints |

> **Presenter Note**: *The biggest win here is identity lifecycle. The biggest trade-off is the walled garden. EMU accounts are enterprise-scoped — they simply cannot exist outside the enterprise boundary. This is a security feature for some orgs and a deal-breaker for others. Also note: you cannot convert an existing standard GHEC enterprise to EMU — it's a new enterprise. So this is a forward-looking decision.*

---

## Slide 10: EMU — Identity Flow Deep Dive

| Step | Action | Where | Automated? |
|------|--------|-------|------------|
| 1 | Admin configures SAML SSO and SCIM in IdP | Entra ID / Okta | Manual (one-time setup) |
| 2 | IdP provisions users into EMU enterprise | GitHub via SCIM | ✅ Automatic |
| 3 | IdP groups map to GitHub teams | GitHub via SCIM | ✅ Automatic |
| 4 | User authenticates via IdP to access GitHub | SAML SSO | ✅ Automatic |
| 5 | User assigned to Orgs/Teams based on IdP group membership | GitHub | ✅ Automatic |
| 6 | User changes role/department → IdP updates groups | GitHub via SCIM | ✅ Automatic |
| 7 | User leaves company → IdP deprovisions account | GitHub via SCIM | ✅ Automatic |
| 8 | All repos, issues, PRs associated with deprovisioned user are retained | GitHub | Enterprise retains data |

Steps 2–7 are fully automated. This is the core value of EMU: **zero manual user management**.

> **Presenter Note**: *The beauty here is steps 2–7 are fully automated. No GitHub admin has to manually add or remove users. The IdP drives everything. But — and this is important — you need to get your IdP group structure right before rolling this out. Changing group-to-team mappings after the fact can be disruptive.*

---

## Slide 11: EMU — When to Choose This Pattern

**Choose EMU Only when:**
- ✅ You need complete control over developer accounts and identity
- ✅ Data loss prevention is a top priority — no code leaving the enterprise boundary
- ✅ Your developers do NOT need to contribute to open source from their work account
- ✅ You want automated provisioning/deprovisioning with zero manual overhead
- ✅ You have a mature IdP setup (Entra ID or Okta) with well-defined groups
- ✅ You are starting fresh or willing to create a new enterprise (no migration from standard GHEC)

**Think twice if:**
- ⚠️ Your developers actively contribute to public open-source projects
- ⚠️ You have an existing GitHub.com presence with community engagement
- ⚠️ You use GitHub Marketplace apps that don't support EMU
- ⚠️ You need flexibility for contractors or external collaborators

> 💡 **Guest Collaborators**: EMU does support a **Guest Collaborator** role for external users. Guest collaborators are provisioned via your IdP like all managed user accounts, but receive a restricted role with limited, repo-scoped access. They cannot see internal repositories unless explicitly added as organization members. Evaluate whether Guest Collaborator meets your needs before dismissing EMU over external collaboration.

> **Presenter Note**: *EMU is the right choice for security-conscious, compliance-first organizations — think financial services, healthcare, government contractors. If your primary concern is "I need to know exactly who has access and automatically revoke it," EMU is your answer. But if you have developers who contribute to upstream open-source projects as part of their job, you'll need a plan for that — typically a separate personal GitHub.com account.*

│   └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Presenter Note**: *This is the most common enterprise pattern. You have a single Enterprise Account that provides consolidated billing, policy inheritance, and audit log aggregation. Under that, you have multiple Organizations — typically one per business unit, department, or compliance boundary. Each org can have its own SSO configuration, its own policies (within the bounds set by the enterprise), and its own teams.*

---

## Slide 14: Multi-Org — Pros, Cons & Requirements

| ✅ Pros | ✗ Cons | 📋 Requirements |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Clear isolation between business units / teams | Cross-org collaboration requires internal repos or cross-org teams | GitHub Enterprise Cloud license |
| Each org can have its own SSO/IdP configuration | Users may need accounts/access in multiple orgs | Enterprise Account created (requires GitHub Sales) |
| Consolidated billing under one Enterprise Account | More administrative overhead managing multiple orgs | At least one Organization configured |
| Enterprise-level policies cascade to all orgs | No single "search all orgs" without Enterprise search | SAML SSO configured per org (or enterprise-level) |
| Supports inner source via internal repo visibility | Team duplication across orgs if people work cross-functionally | Org naming convention and ownership model defined |
| Org owners can self-manage within guardrails | Audit log is aggregated but can be noisy across many orgs | Enterprise owner(s) designated |
| Flexible — orgs can be added/removed as business evolves | Actions minutes/storage shared at enterprise level (contention) | Policy hierarchy documented and communicated |
| Users keep their GitHub.com accounts (personal + work) | Standards drift — orgs may configure differently over time | |
| Marketplace apps work normally | Secret sprawl if not governed centrally | |

> **Presenter Note**: *The multi-org pattern offers the best balance of isolation and flexibility. The key challenge is governance — how do you prevent standards drift when each org owner can configure things differently? The answer is enterprise-level policies that set the floor, and clear documentation of what each org can customize. The other common pain point is cross-org collaboration — if a developer needs to work on repos in three different orgs, they need access in all three.*

---

## Slide 15: Multi-Org — Common Organization Strategies

| Strategy | Example Structure | Best For | Trade-offs |
|----------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| **Org per Business Unit** | `contoso-finance`, `contoso-engineering`, `contoso-marketing` | Large enterprises with distinct BUs and separate leadership | Cross-BU collaboration requires cross-org access |
| **Org per Compliance Tier** | `contoso-regulated`, `contoso-general`, `contoso-opensource` | Enterprises with mixed compliance requirements (FedRAMP, SOC2, HIPAA) | Developers may need access to multiple orgs |
| **Org per Acquisition** | `contoso-core`, `acquired-company-a`, `acquired-company-b` | Post-M&A integration — keep acquired company repos separate initially | Can lead to org sprawl if not consolidated over time |
| **Shared Platform Org** | `contoso-platform` alongside BU orgs | CI/CD templates, shared libraries, inner source — accessible to all | Governance of shared org requires clear ownership |
| **Org per Environment** | `contoso-production`, `contoso-staging`, `contoso-sandbox` | Organizations wanting environment isolation | Uncommon; environments are better separated at repo/branch level |

**Most common pattern**: Org-per-BU + a shared platform org for CI/CD templates, reusable Actions, and inner source libraries.

> **Presenter Note**: *There's no single right answer here. The most common pattern we see is org-per-BU plus a shared platform org. The compliance-tier approach is growing — especially in regulated industries where you want different policy sets for regulated vs. non-regulated code. Post-acquisition is interesting because it lets you bring an acquired company onto your enterprise billing without immediately reorganizing their repos.*

## Slide 16: Multi-Org — Policy Inheritance Model

```
    Enterprise Account
    ├── Base repository permissions ────────── "Read" (minimum floor)
    ├── Repository creation ────────────────── "Members can create"
    ├── Repository forking ─────────────────── "Allowed for private repos"
    ├── Actions permissions ────────────────── "Allow select actions"
    ├── Copilot policies ───────────────────── "Enabled for all orgs"
    │
    ├── Org: Finance (can RESTRICT, cannot RELAX)
    │   ├── Base permissions ───────────────── "Read" ✅ (matches enterprise)
    │   ├── Repository creation ────────────── "Disabled" ✅ (more restrictive)
    │   ├── Forking ────────────────────────── "Disabled" ✅ (more restrictive)
    │   └── Copilot ────────────────────────── "Enabled" (inherited)
    │
    └── Org: Engineering (can RESTRICT, cannot RELAX)
        ├── Base permissions ───────────────── "Write" ✗ (cannot exceed "Read")
        ├── Repository creation ────────────── "Members can create" ✅ (matches)
        ├── Forking ────────────────────────── "Allowed" ✅ (matches enterprise)
        └── Copilot ────────────────────────── "Enabled" (inherited)
```

> **Presenter Note**: *This is critical to understand. Enterprise policies use a binary enforce/don't-enforce model. When an enterprise ENFORCES a policy, it locks in a specific value — organizations cannot change it, effectively setting a floor. If the enterprise enforces "forking is disabled," no org can re-enable it. When a policy is NOT enforced, orgs have full autonomy. This is the governance model that prevents standards drift — enforce your security baseline at the enterprise level and let orgs tighten where needed.*

---

## Slide 17: Multi-Org — When to Choose This Pattern

**Choose Multi-Org when:**
- ✅ You have distinct business units or departments that need autonomy
- ✅ Different groups need different SSO/IdP configurations
- ✅ You want consolidated billing but decentralized administration
- ✅ Your developers contribute to public open-source projects
- ✅ You need isolation between teams for regulatory or compliance reasons
- ✅ You're migrating from multiple existing GitHub orgs or other platforms

**Think twice if:**
- ⚠️ You need absolute control over account lifecycle (consider EMU instead)
- ⚠️ Your org count grows past 10–15 — administrative overhead increases
- ⚠️ You need to prevent any code from leaving the enterprise boundary
- ⚠️ Cross-org collaboration is more common than within-org work

> **Presenter Note**: *Multi-Org is the default recommendation for most enterprises. It gives you the right balance of control and flexibility. The main question is whether you combine it with EMU — you can have an EMU enterprise with multiple orgs, getting the best of both worlds: lifecycle control AND organizational isolation.*

> **Presenter Note**: *This is the hybrid pattern. You run GHEC in the cloud for your non-regulated workloads, open source, and anything that benefits from cloud-native features like Copilot and Codespaces. You run GHES on-premises — in your data center or private cloud — for regulated, sensitive, or air-gap-required workloads. GitHub Connect bridges the two, providing unified search, contribution graphs, Dependabot, and license synchronization. Importantly, the connection is outbound-only from GHES — your on-prem server initiates the connection, no inbound firewall rules needed.*

---

## Slide 20: Mixed — Pros, Cons & Requirements

| ✅ Pros | ✗ Cons | 📋 Requirements |
|---------|--------|------------------|
| Data residency — regulated code stays on-premises | Two platforms to manage, patch, and secure | GHEC license + GHES license (bundled with GHE) |
| Air-gap capable — GHES can run fully disconnected | GHES requires infrastructure: VMs, storage, backups, HA | On-prem infrastructure (VMs, storage, networking) |
| GitHub Connect bridges cloud ↔ on-prem | Copilot, Codespaces, and other cloud-only features unavailable on GHES | Dedicated admin team for GHES operations |
| Unified search across both environments (with Connect) | Developer experience split — different UIs, different versions | GitHub Connect configured (outbound HTTPS 443) |
| Unified contribution graph (with Connect) | GHES version may lag behind GHEC feature set | GHES upgrade schedule and patching process |
| Compliance — meet regulatory requirements (FedRAMP, ITAR, etc.) | Actions on GHES requires self-hosted runners | Self-hosted runners for on-prem Actions |
| GHAS available on both cloud and on-prem | No single audit log — separate for GHEC and GHES | Backup/DR plan for GHES appliance |
| License sync between GHEC and GHES (with Connect) | Higher total cost of ownership (infra + ops + licensing) | Network connectivity for GitHub Connect |
| Gradual migration path — move workloads cloud-ward over time | Cross-environment PRs/issues not natively supported | |

> **Presenter Note**: *The hybrid pattern is the most operationally complex. You're running two platforms. The key question to ask is: "Do you ACTUALLY need air-gap, or is data residency sufficient?" For data residency without air-gap, GHE.com (GHEC with data residency) gives you regional storage in EU, Australia, US, or Japan with full cloud features including Copilot. GHES is the right choice when you have genuine air-gap requirements or disconnected-network mandates.*

---

## Slide 21: GitHub Connect — Feature Matrix

| GitHub Connect Feature | Description | Requires |
|------------------------|-------------|----------|
| **Unified Search** | Search code across both GHEC and GHES from either interface | GitHub Connect enabled |
| **Unified Contributions** | GHES contributions appear on GitHub.com profile | GitHub Connect enabled |
| **Dependabot** | GHES repos can use GitHub.com advisory database | GitHub Connect enabled |
| **Actions — GitHub.com Actions** | GHES can use Actions from GitHub.com Marketplace | GitHub Connect enabled |
| **Server Statistics** | Aggregated usage data sent to GHEC for analysis | GitHub Connect enabled |
| **License Sync** | Unified license management across GHEC + GHES | GitHub Connect enabled |

> **Presenter Note**: *GitHub Connect is the glue. It's a set of opt-in features that bridge the cloud and on-prem worlds. Each feature can be enabled independently. The most popular features are unified search — so developers don't have to mentally track "which server has this repo?" — and Actions sync, so GHES can use community Actions from the Marketplace without manual import. Note: if you're connecting to an enterprise on GHE.com (data residency), Server Statistics and GitHub.com Actions are not available via GitHub Connect.*

---

## Slide 22: Mixed — When to Choose This Pattern

**Choose Mixed Cloud + On-Prem when:**
- ✅ You need **air-gapped** environments for classified or ultra-sensitive workloads
- ✅ You have existing on-prem infrastructure investments you can't sunset yet
- ✅ Different teams have different compliance levels — cloud is fine for some, on-prem required for others
- ✅ You're in a gradual cloud migration — GHES today, GHEC tomorrow

> **🟣 Consider GHE.com first**: If data residency (not air-gap) is the primary driver, evaluate **GHEC with data residency on GHE.com** before committing to GHES. GHE.com offers regional data storage (EU, Australia, US, Japan) with full cloud features — including Copilot and GitHub Actions hosted runners — and avoids the operational overhead of self-hosted infrastructure. All GHE.com enterprises use EMU by default.
>
> **Note**: Codespaces is now available on GHE.com in **public preview**. Check the [GHE.com feature overview](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/data-residency/feature-overview-for-github-enterprise-cloud-with-data-residency) for current status and any limitations.

**Think twice if:**
- ⚠️ "On-prem" is driven by perception rather than actual regulatory requirement
- ⚠️ You don't have the ops team to manage GHES upgrades, backups, and infrastructure
- ⚠️ Copilot and Codespaces are critical for your developer experience (not available on GHES)
- ⚠️ Total cost of ownership for GHES infrastructure exceeds the risk mitigation value
- ⚠️ GHEC's built-in controls (EMU, IP allow lists, data residency on GHE.com, audit logging) already meet your compliance needs

> **Presenter Note**: *I want to be honest here: we see a lot of organizations running GHES because "security says we need on-prem" when the actual regulatory requirement could be met with GHEC's built-in controls. The key question is: do you need AIR-GAP, or do you need DATA RESIDENCY? If it's data residency, point them to GHE.com — GHEC with data residency. It gives them regional data storage in the EU, Australia, US, or Japan with full cloud features including Copilot. If they truly need air-gap or disconnected operation, then yes, GHES is the right call. Make sure the on-prem requirement is tied to a specific regulation or certification — not just organizational inertia.*

# Architecture Decision Framework
### Comparing the Three Base Patterns Side by Side

---

## Slide 25: Master Comparison Matrix — Base Patterns

| Dimension | 🔵 EMU Only | 🟢 Multi-Org (Standard GHEC) | 🟠 Mixed Cloud + GHES |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Identity Control** | ✅ Full IdP lifecycle (SCIM) | ⚠️ SAML SSO (manual account mgmt) | ⚠️ Split (GHEC SSO + GHES LDAP/SAML) |
| **Account Ownership** | ✅ Enterprise owns accounts | ✗ User owns accounts | ✗ Mixed |
| **Data Residency** | ⚠️ Cloud (US/EU/AU/JP regions); 🟣 GHE.com for regional residency | ⚠️ Cloud (US/EU/AU/JP regions); 🟣 GHE.com for regional residency | ✅ On-prem for sensitive data |
| **Air-Gap Support** | ✗ None | ✗ None | ✅ GHES can be air-gapped |
| **Copilot Available** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ⚠️ GHEC only (not GHES) |
| **GHAS Available** | ✅ Full | ✅ Full | ✅ Both GHEC and GHES |
| **Codespaces** | ✅ Available | ✅ Available | ⚠️ GHEC only |
| **Public OSS Contribution** | ✗ Not from EMU accounts | ✅ Yes | ✅ From GHEC accounts |
| **Inner Source** | ✅ Internal repos | ✅ Internal repos | ⚠️ Per-platform only |
| **Admin Complexity** | 🟢 Low | 🟡 Medium | 🔴 High |
| **Infrastructure Ops** | ✗ None (SaaS) | ✗ None (SaaS) | 🔴 GHES requires infra |
| **Cost Model** | Per-seat (GHEC) | Per-seat (GHEC) | Per-seat (GHEC + GHES) + infra |
| **Migration Effort** | 🟡 Medium (new enterprise) | 🟢 Low | 🔴 High |
| **Best For** | Regulated / security-first orgs | Most enterprises | Data sovereignty / air-gap |

> **Presenter Note**: *This is your cheat sheet for the three base patterns. No pattern is universally best — each optimizes for different constraints. For most enterprises without specific regulatory requirements, Multi-Org or EMU Only is the right starting point. Mixed is for genuine on-prem needs.*

```

> **Presenter Note**: *This is the core decision. On-prem needs push you to Mixed, identity control pushes you to EMU, otherwise Multi-Org is the default for most enterprises.*

## Slide 27: Common Hybrid Patterns & Combinations

| Hybrid Pattern | Description | When to Use |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **EMU + Multi-Org** | EMU enterprise with multiple orgs per business unit | Security-first enterprise with distinct business units — most common enterprise pattern |
| **EMU + Non-EMU Org** | EMU enterprise for corporate work + separate non-EMU org for open-source | Developers who contribute to upstream OSS as part of their job |
| **Multi-Org + GHES** | GHEC multi-org with GHES for regulated workloads via Connect | Mixed compliance tiers — some code cloud-OK, some must be on-prem |

> **Presenter Note**: *Real-world architectures are often hybrids. The most common hybrid we see is EMU + Multi-Org — you get lifecycle control AND organizational isolation. These combinations give you the flexibility to tailor GitHub to your organization's specific needs.*

---

## Slide 28: Recommendations by Organization Profile

| Organization Profile | Recommended Base Pattern | Key Reason |
|----------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| **Startup / Scale-up** | 🟢 Multi-Org (standard GHEC) | Simple, flexible, lowest admin overhead |
| **Mid-size Enterprise (500–5,000)** | 🔵 EMU + Multi-Org | Identity control + org isolation, scales well |
| **Large Enterprise (5,000+, no regulation)** | 🔵 EMU + Multi-Org | Full lifecycle automation at scale |
| **Regulated Enterprise (finance, healthcare)** | 🔵 EMU Only, 🟣 GHE.com (data residency), or 🟠 Mixed + EMU | Data control, compliance, audit trail; evaluate GHE.com before GHES |
| **Government / Defense** | 🟠 Mixed (GHEC + GHES air-gapped) or 🟣 GHE.com (if no air-gap needed) | Data sovereignty, air-gap requirements, ITAR |
| **Acquisitive Enterprise (M&A)** | 🟢 Multi-Org (org per acquisition) | Onboard acquired companies without disruption |
| **OSS-Heavy Enterprise** | 🟢 Multi-Org (standard, no EMU) | Developers need public GitHub.com access |

> **Presenter Note**: *This table gives you the quick recommendation by organization profile. For most organizations, the base pattern decision is driven by identity control, compliance requirements, and open-source participation.*

---

# SECTION 6: Q&A & Discussion

---

## Slide 29: Discussion Questions

**Let's discuss:**

1. **Identity & Access**: Do you need complete IdP-based account lifecycle control, or is SAML SSO sufficient?
2. **Data Residency**: Do you have genuine regulatory requirements for on-premises data storage? Which regulation?
3. **Open Source**: Do your developers contribute to public open-source projects as part of their work?
4. **Base Architecture**: Based on the three patterns we covered, which one fits your organization?
5. **Developer Experience**: Is Copilot a priority? How important is a unified developer experience across all teams?
6. **Compliance**: What compliance frameworks apply (SOC2, FedRAMP, HIPAA, ITAR, GDPR)?
7. **Timeline**: Is this a "decide now" or a "plan for next year" decision?

> **Presenter Note**: *Open this up for discussion. Expect the most debate around "do we really need on-prem?" and identity lifecycle requirements — those are the highest-stakes decisions. Use these questions to help the audience self-identify the right pattern.*
